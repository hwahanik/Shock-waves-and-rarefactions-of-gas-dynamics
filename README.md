# Shock-waves-and-rarefactions-of-gas-dynamics

Research on Riemann problems for conservation laws modelling carbon dioxide injection in porous media, for simultaneous storage and geothermal energy recovery.

Here we solve the Riemann problem for the system of partial differential equations that describes the two-phase flow of carbon and water in porous media flow.  This system is also a conservation law, therefore weak solutions to the jump-initial value problem consist sequences of shock waves, rarefactions, and intermediate states.

These solutions can be found by analyzing the phase space of the system, and looking for the shock wave and rarefaction wave curves.

A specialized software, the RPn package (Riemann-Problem in n-dimesions) was created for this analysis.  It is written in C++. C. with a GUI in Java.
